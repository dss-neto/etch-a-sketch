# Project: Etch A Sketch

A project based on the [toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) that goes by the same name. Part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Description

This project consists in a grid (made with Flexbox, though) of divs, which, once the mouse hovers, may have their colors changed.

There was a challenge surrounding this, which involved not changing the HTML nor CSS internally, only externally through JavaScript.
